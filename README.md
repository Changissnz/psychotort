This project has been started just by me, but it is not original. I am confident above a typically-confident level that someone, somewhere over the rainbow
has infrasonic hardware, polluting this already noise-polluted world with whatever narratives that they want their listeners' ears to take in. 

Please, although I may be mute,deaf, and dumb because you may think so (ain't it so?!), I would like to explain some of the applications of an infrasound device.
Infrasound is slight: a human's ears can barely register it. So why would anyone want to build infrasonic programs that can be used by infrasonic hardware. The
simple answer is that human ears can still register infrasonic sound, and humans do not always get to choose their time and setting. 

The aim of this project is to create an infrasonic program that can be be uploaded into hardware with infrasonic capabilities. 

Here is the kicker, people. I never got COLLEGED in the field of infrasonics. What do I do? What do I do? Do I go look for someone that got colleged in 
the field of infrasonics? What social circle, 1 through X, would provide the best information for the best price?

I am stuck. And I do not know what to do but stare at my own reflection and review all the memories, authentic and otherwise, in my bwain, knowing that that 
reflection and all my memories may just be the product of an infrasonic device currently in operation by someone.
