This project has been started just by me, but it is not original. I am confident above a typically-confident level that someone, somewhere over the rainbow
has infrasonic hardware, polluting this already noise-polluted world with whatever narratives that they want their listeners' ears to take in. 

Please, although I may be mute,deaf, and dumb because you may think so (ain't it so?!), I would like to explain some of the applications of an infrasound device.
Infrasound is slight: a human's ears can barely register it. So why would anyone want to build infrasonic programs that can be used by infrasonic hardware. The
simple answer is that human ears can still register infrasonic sound, and humans do not always get to choose their time and setting. 

The aim of this project is to create an infrasonic program that can be be uploaded into hardware with infrasonic capabilities. 

Here is the kicker, people. I never got COLLEGED in the field of infrasonics. What do I do? What do I do? Do I go look for someone that got colleged in 
the field of infrasonics? What social circle, 1 through X, would provide the best information for the best price?

Sigh, I am stuck and lost. And I do not know what to do but stare at my own reflection and review all the memories, authentic and otherwise, in my bwain, knowing 
that that reflection and all my memories may just be the product of an infrasonic device currently in operation by someone.

HEY GUYZZZZZ, I'm back with some new inklings on Psychotort.

**Sci-Fi Thoughts**

Imagine a world where miscommunication is a relic. Miscommunication has been eradicated in this
world thanks to widespread adoption of infrasound technology by society. By the way, in this 
world, miscommunication is defined as communicating the wrong message. The wrong message is one 
which may be interpreted as wrong by the sender, in comparison to what they actually want to 
communicate, or according to the listener, what they actually want to hear. In this world, 
people have to simply think the thoughts that they want to send. These thoughts do not have to 
be represented as auditory or visual information. They simply just have to exist in the minds of
the senders that want to send them to their intended listeners for the listeners to receive 
them. Then infrasonic technology will precisely capture these senders' thoughts, and send them 
the listeners! No verbal or written communication is necessary for messages to get across! Words, spoken
in sweet or sour tones, can be misinterpreted! And written words are just plain ole confusing 
to read! Who reads anyways, AMIRITE? But when infrasonic technology became increasingly more 
advanced and adopted by society, things changed. People could send their thoughts to one another
and not risk any miscommunication whatsoever!

Is this not a lovely and unbelievable world? 

**Personal Thoughts**

The fields that this personal project focuses on are psycho-acoustics and audiology. During 
the  spare time that I have dedicated to this project, I will mainly read research papers and 
articles pertinent to these topics. The field of psycho-acoustics is fascinating because it
seeks to understand how human beings interpret auditory information after they have received 
it. This additional layer of interpretation after the layer of reception is the primary focus
of psycho-acoustics. 

I do not believe I will find any "hard" formulas or principles from this study into psycho-
acoustics. I have not gone in deep into the topic yet, but I suppose psycho-acoustics is a
craft that can yield variable results due to influences from the fields of psychology and 
sociology. Accurate experimental data is probably more difficult to collect in this field.
The field should not be discredited though, because audio devices are a mainstay of 
the present and the future, and the field does offer a template for operating and administering
audio devices for communication. 


**References and Sources**
In this section, I will list references and sources pertinent to audiology.
